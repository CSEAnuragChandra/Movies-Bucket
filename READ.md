## 📌 About the Project

**Movies Bucket** is a personal frontend-focused project developed during my learning journey to understand **API integration, client-side state management, and secure application architecture**.

The application allows users to search for movies, view posters, and save their favorite movies.  
To ensure API security, all third-party API calls are routed through a **serverless backend proxy** instead of being made directly from the browser.

This project is included in my resume to demonstrate both **frontend skills** and **backend-aware design decisions**.
